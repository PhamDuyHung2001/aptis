          A: "I have a dream that I work as a tour guide. So I understand that I will have to fly to other countries. In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment, so I believe we should add taxes to airline ticket prices to make people choose to use other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to protecting the environment.",
          B: "My family and siblings live quite far from me. So I often have to fly to visit them every month when I have time. We really appreciate the time we spend together and we are happy to be able to meet each other and share our new story. I know that traveling by plane too much is not good for the environment so I often shop online or go to work by bike instead of going by car or I reuse plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood.",
          C: "I was a businessman so I had to fly many times a week. I had to go to other countries to be able to sign wine trading contracts with them. I felt very tired every time I have to fly. Now, my sister and I, whenever we have free time, take the train together and we enjoy that time very much because I can travel while sightseeing and relax without any stress.",
          D: "If I have to go somewhere I will choose other means of public transport, not the plane. Every time I go on a plane I feel extremely tired and I just hope time passes quickly so I can get off that plane. However, due to the specific nature of my job, I have to film in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take this public transportation."

          A: "This is my first time coming to this restaurant. The food is very cheap but the quality is excellent. I was very surprised with the starter because its menu is very diverse. But there is one thing that I want the restaurant to improve. The restaurant band played live music but it was very far away, so the sound was very low and it didn't make the meal atmosphere lively. Next time turn the music louder, please!",
          B: "This is a very famous restaurant that I saw in the newspaper. Sadly, I arrived later than the rest of the party, so I didn't get to order dinner. However, I ordered orange juice and mango juice and they were both delicious. What about the surroundings? Lively music along with fashionable and appropriate decor makes me feel very comfortable.",
          C: "I'm not sure if I will return to this restaurant. I think the staff was arguing when I got there, because the atmosphere here was not very comfortable. As for the food, I think there's nothing to write about. I ordered fish and chips, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. But many people say that the food here is fabulous. So, I think I'm an exception",
          D: "I don't understand why this restaurant is so famous. When I arrived and saw a menu with lots of different dishes, I saw this as a bad sign. Furthermore, the menu with traditional dishes contrasting with the modern decoration style made me feel very confused and strange. The waiters here were also not friendly. This was one of my worst experiences eating at a restaurant."

          A: "My wife often complains about not having time to read, and I say we have to make our own time. So, I often calculate my free time on my phone. so I can know in advance whether I should bring a book to read on the train. My wife often laughs at me for doing so, but I don't mind, as long as I can finish reading so many books.",
          B: "I used to struggle very much to finish reading a book that we were expected to read. However, now that I read for my own pleasure, I don't mind too much. I usually don't limit myself to reading one at a time. There are so many titles I can choose from that get me excited. I have a list of books that I want to read in the future.",
          C: "I often keep a book on the bedside table to read before going to bed. The problem is, I get tired after reading only half of a page, and I fall asleep. So, I've been reading that one book for half a year now and have only read chapter 2. However, when I read factual books, I find it very interesting and it keeps me awake for hours.",
          D: "My job requires reading a lot of books. These books include a lot of facts and figures and they are very boring. When I have free time, I usually want to read light books, like mystery novels or comedy. I often read on the train to work. I have a young child, so when I come home I almost don't have time to read. Therefore, I have to read books when traveling by train. So, a book can last me 1 week."

          "A": "When I first came to this city, I felt very scared because this city is very big. The city has many parts and the shopping part is very far from the green part. However, we already had the bus route and we signed up to take the bus for a full day. Buses are very cheap and very convenient. I feel very lucky to not have to put pressure on my sore feet.",
          "B": "I don't like big cities and rarely go out to cities. But I go to the StevenSon city very often. I go there about five to seven times a year. There is an area outside the city. In that area, there are many things that I need. There is a lot of water, a natural area, a small forest and a special camping area. I really like coming to this place to rest. It also has a great coffee serving area for visitors.",
          "C": "I went to this city last summer and really liked the atmosphere of this city. The reason I like the atmosphere here is because it has a lot of public performances. These performances often take place in front of department stores. So this prevents me from shopping inside those stores. I was very surprised when I came home with an empty bag and I didn't buy anything.",
          "D": "When I go out, I only care about two things: good food and a good play. I especially liked the lunch I had in this city, it was delicious and I really want to come back here next time. However, I guess it's a bit expensive and I have to walk a long way to get there. However, it didn't matter because I had a wonderful day."

          "B": "Buses are often full of people, especially during rush hour. This makes me very uncomfortable when I have to travel to work by bus. The public transportation improvement plan proposed by the city is very reasonable and it will improve the above situation a lot.",
          "C": "In my opinion, the bus is very clean and comfortable to travel. I find it has a lot of space for everyone, and the bus system is also very large. Therefore, I think improving the public transport system is unnecessary, while the old system is still good.",
          "D": "Building a new public transportation system will be very costly. And we all know it's at the expense of residents. I think we should use that money for something more beneficial, which is building more hospitals. Hospitals in this living area are very few."

My forte in drawing is animals, especially big and ferocious animals.",
          "B": "I find going to see paintings similar to reading books. You must look and read before discussing. When I go to exhibitions with my friends, they often talk before seeing the painting, and what they talk about isn't even about the painting, that's annoy me.",

Besides, students and schools also have days off on weekends. I think this volunteering will be very helpful for students' future careers.",
          "C": "I think this volunteering is a good idea but it doesn't have a long-term vision. When volunteers clean up the park, it will be clean, but it will become busy again after about a month when tourist season arrives. I think we should clean this park regularly about once a month. Surrounding areas such as the lake and local forest should also be cleaned up. We should also have signs telling visitors to clean up their trash. I am very upset when I see a lot of trash on both sides of the road.",

However, it also makes finding food and drinks more difficult.",

I will go around the area to see the architecture of the houses. I chose to go around by taxi, it was great. However, it cost me a lot because I traveled alone and had no one to share the costs with.

My dad is a good cook, he knows what ingredients I don't like to eat, which obviously are a lot. I love being home and eating with my family."

This new station won't solve the traffic jams, and it will require the city's budget every year. Therefore, we won't have money left to build a hospital while health should be a priority. I believe it's better to invest in health services instead.",
          "B": "The new station will be in the residential area, close to the hospital and university. We already have buses for getting around, and even though they might be slow sometimes, that's not a reason for being late. I always go to work on time, and I think everyone should work on their personal schedule. People often blame traffic for being late. but I manage to avoid that.",
          "C": "I take the train to work every day, and I am tired of the overcrowded trains. I believe investing in a new station is worthwhile, as it could enhance the transportation system and alleviate congestion at the current station. We should consider placing the new station in densely populated residential areas, as this would improve train travel and help reduce crowding.",
          "D": "The city planners say that investing in a new station may not be necessary. Both the current station and the bus services appear to work well. Although I don't use trains regularly, I have found the service to be satisfactory whenever I do. The existing facilities are adequate, and I don't see a pressing need to spend money on a new station at this time."
